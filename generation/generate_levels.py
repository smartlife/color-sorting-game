"""Level generation utilities for the color sorting game.

Levels are produced by starting from a solved configuration and then
applying a number of *legal* moves at random.  Because each move obeys the
game rules, simply reversing the sequence leads back to the solution.  The
amount of scrambling per level is controlled through ``DIFFICULTY_STEPS``.
Running the module will create ``levels.json`` inside the generation folder.

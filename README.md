# Color Sorting Game

A minimal web-based game skeleton that demonstrates how to manage multiple screens on a mobile layout. The game includes:

- **Start Screen** – presented when the page loads. Press **Start** to begin.
- **Game Screen** – shows the current level. Press **Complete Level** to finish a level.
- **Level Completed Screen** – displays when a level is completed. Press **Next Level** to continue to the next level.

Each screen fills the entire viewport so there is no scrolling on mobile devices. The JavaScript manages transitions between screens and keeps track of the current level number, starting from 1.

This project is intended as a simple starting point for expanding into a full puzzle game where players sort colors into the correct order.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to try the demo. No build step or external dependencies are required.
